# HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY: TERMINAL OS v1.984

> **WARNING**: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.
> *This system monitors dimensional stability and tracks threats across Hawkins and the Upside Down.*

## 📋 System Overview

The **Hawkins Incident Command Console** is an immersive, browser-based operating system designed to simulate the experience of a 1980s containment operator. It serves as the central hub for monitoring the thinning veil between our world and the **Upside Down**.

Operators use this console to calibrate psychic signals, track anomalous creatures, and coordinate field agents in real-time. The interface features authentic retro-futuristic aesthetics, including CRT emulation, chromatic aberration, and reactive audio systems.

## 🚀 Initialization Protocols

To access the secure mainframe, all operators must complete the boot sequence:
1.  **BIOS Load**: Wait for the HNL (Hawkins National Lab) kernel to initialize.
2.  **Signal Calibration**: Use the **Signal Calibrator** to align frequency and signal strength (Target Range: 70-90) and lock onto the interdimensional carrier wave.
3.  **Authentication**: Enter the daily clearance code: **`HAWKINS1983`**.

## 🕹️ key Features

### 📡 Dimensional Monitoring System
*   **Dual-Reality Interface**: Seamlessly switch between **Standard Mode** (Amber/Green) and **Upside Down Mode** (Red/Corrupted).
*   **Reality Shift (`U`)**: Toggling modes changes the UI palette, unlocks hidden ambient audio, and reveals "glitched" data from the other side.
*   **Particle Anomalies**: Reacts to dimensional instability with visual particle effects (Ash/Spores).

### 🚨 Real-Time Incident Tracking
*   **Live Feed**: Monitor threats ranging from "Power Surges" to "Demogorgon Sightings".
*   **Classification**: Incidents are tagged by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Low).
*   **Dimension Origin**: New reports can be flagged as originating from the **Real World** or the **Upside Down**.
*   **Status Workflow**: Mark incidents as *Investigating*, *Contained*, or *Resolved*.

### 📟 Command Line Interface (CMD)
A fully functional terminal for advanced users (Tab: `CMD`).
*   **Inline Command Prompt**: Type directly into the console history.
*   **System Commands**:
    *   `/HELP`: Displays the full operator manual.
    *   `/INCIDENT`: Launches the reporting form.
    *   `/STAT`: Shows current threat matrix statistics.
    *   `/DOOM`: Activates simulation protocols.

### 🎛️ Signal Calibrator
A specialized tool for stabilizing the connection to the Upside Down.
*   **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust Signal Strength and Frequency to find the "sweet spot".
*   **Visual Feedback**: Real-time waveform visualization.
*   **Audio Feedback**: Dynamic static and beep frequencies guide you to the lock.

## ⌨️ Operator Controls (Shortcuts)

Efficiency is key during a containment breach. Use these keyboard shortcuts:

| Key | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`LEFT` / `RIGHT`** | **Navigate Tabs** | Cycle through Incidents, Field Agents, Maps, and CMD. |
| **`U`** | **Reality Shift** | Toggle between Real World and Upside Down mode. |
| **`C`** | **Calibrator** | Open/Close the Signal Calibration tool. |
| **`N`** | **New Report** | Quickly open the "Log New Incident" form. |
| **`CMD+K`** | **Clear Terminal** | (In Terminal) Clears the screen. |

## 🎧 Audio & Immersion
*   **Reactive Soundscape**: The system features distinct audio profiles for each dimension.
    *   *Real World*: Computer hums, mechanical clicks, data beeps.
    *   *Upside Down*: Organic growls, distant thunder, unsettling ambient drones.
*   **Dynamic Music**: Music intensifies based on the current threat level or active tab.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications
This simulation is built using modern web technologies to recreate 1980s hardware limitations:
*   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (React)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CRT animations.
*   **Motion**: Framer Motion for complex transitions and boot sequences.
*   **Audio**: Web Audio API for real-time sound synthesis and spatial effects.
*   **State**: LocalStorage persistence for saving session incidents and settings.
