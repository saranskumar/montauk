## 📜 Problem Statement
**Hawkins doesn't just need heroes. It needs developers.**

This project is a browser-based **Incident Command Console** used by Hawkins authorities to monitor the rising danger from the Upside Down. It serves as a centralized hub for tracking abnormal activity, logging threats, and coordinating the defense of our reality.

Built as a single-page application (SPA), it operates entirely client-side with persistent storage, delivering a highly immersive, cinematic experience inspired by 1980s military terminals.

## 🛠 Features

### 🖥️ Core Functionality
- **Incident List**: View all active threats in Hawkins. Sort by latest/oldest and filter by threat level (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Low).
- **Incident Details**: Click any incident to open a "Classified File" view with full details, location, and recommended actions.
- **Report New Incident**: A dedicated form to log new anomalies. Data is validated and added to the live feed immediately.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: All data persists across page reloads—the fight doesn't end when you close the tab.

### 🌌 The "Upside Down" Mode
- **One-Click Toggle**: Press the `U` key or use the header toggle to switch realities.
- **Visual Overhaul**: The interface transforms from "Standard Command" (Amber/Orange) to "Corrupted" (Red/Darkness).
- **Glitch Effects**: Screen tearing, chromatic aberration, and atmospheric particles intensify.

### 🎛️ Retro Terminal Experience
- **Immersive Boot Sequence**: BIOS check, memory count, and "Signal Calibration" minigame before login.
- **Audio Feedback**: Authentic 80s clicks, hums, and alarm sounds (Calibration required interaction).
- **Mini HUDs**:
  - **Signal Wave**: Real-time oscilloscope visualizing dimension coherence.
  - **Threat Matrix**: Live dashboard of active threat counts.
- **CRT Effects**: Scanlines, film grain, and screen curvature for that authentic 1984 feel.
