# PROJECT HAWKINS: Incident Command Console

> **montauk**  
> *A classified system to track strange events, threats, and Upside Down activity in Hawkins.*

## � Mission Briefing
**Hawkins doesn't just need heroes. It needs operators.**

This Incident Command Console is the central nervous system for Hawkins National Laboratory and local authorities. It allows operators to monitor the thinning veil between our world and the **Upside Down**, tracking anomalies in real-time before they escalate into town-wide catastrophes.

Designed as a **cinematic, immersive experience**, this console operates entirely in the browser, simulating the look and feel of 1980s military hardware corrupted by interdimensional interference.

## � Deployment & Access

### **Authorized Access Required**
To access the classified mainframes, you must bypass the initial security protocols:
1. **Initialize Boot Sequence**: Wait for the BIOS to load classified protocols.
2. **Calibrate Signal**: Use the sliders to stabilize the psychic frequency.
3. **Enter Passcode**: `HAWKINS1983`

## 🕹️ System Capabilities

### 1. **Real-Time Threat Tracking**
Monitor the safety of Hawkins with a live feed of reported incidents.
- **Incident Feed**: View active anomalies, ranging from "Lights Flickering" to "Demogorgon Sightings".
- **Threat Classification**: Incidents are color-coded by severity (Critical, Severe, Moderate, Low).
- **Status Management**: Mark threats as *Investigating*, *Contained*, or *Resolved* directly from the dashboard.

### 2. **Dimensional Monitoring (The "Upside Down" Mode)**
The console is sensitive to dimensional rifts.
- **Toggle Reality**: Press **`U`** or use the specialized toggle switch to view the raw data from the Upside Down.
- **Visual Corruption**: The interface shifts from standard Amber/Orange to a corrupted Red, revealing hidden details and increasing system instability (glitches, static).

### 3. **Signal & Personnel Surveillance**
- **Signal Wave HUD**: A real-time oscilloscope in the bottom-right corner visualizes the stability of the gate.
- **Threat Matrix**: An always-on HUD displaying the total count of active critical and severe threats.
- **Live User Tracking**: Hit **`F2`** to track the status of key personnel (e.g., Hopper, Eleven, Dustin) in the field.

### 4. **Incident Management**
- **Detailed Reports**: Open any incident file to view classified metadata, location tags, and recommended actions.
- **Log New Threats**: Field agents can use the **Log Incident** form to submit new reports instantly.
- **Persistent Data**: The system uses local storage to ensure your logs survive a browser refresh.

### 5. **Command Line Interface (CMD)**
Access the terminal mainframe via the `CMD` tab for advanced control.
- **System Commands**:
  - `/HELP`: List all available commands.
  - `/INCIDENT`: Launch incident reporting protocol.
  - `/DOOM`: NEUTRALIZE ALL ACTIVE THREATS (Simulation Mode).
  - `/STAT`: Display current threat matrix data.

### 6. **Operator Controls**
- **Navigation**: Use **Arrow Keys (Left/Right)** to cycle through main screens.
- **Reality Shift**: Press **`U`** to toggle Upside Down mode.
- **Calibration**: Press **`C`** to toggle the Signal Calibrator tool.
- **Quick Report**: Press **`N`** to open the New Incident form.

## 🎛️ Architecture
**Single-Page Operating System**
- **Client-Side Storage**: No external server required; data lives in your secure local instance.
- **Responsive Interface**: Fully operational on desktop terminals and mobile field devices.
- **Retro-Authenticity**: Built with CRT scanlines, chromatic aberration, and period-accurate typography.
